Introduction
============
FCore is a .NET numerical library with an F# API. It contains F# types and functions which will allow you to manipulate multidimensional dense and 2D sparse matrices as well as generate random numbers. 
For maximum performance most functions are implemented in C using Intel MKL.

It is organised into the following namespaces and modules:

* **FCore** - contains the main types such as BoolVector, Vector, BoolMatrix, Matrix... 
* **FCore.BasicStats** - contains standard statistical functions, such as mean.
* **FCore.LinearAlgebra** - contains linear algebra functions, such as for cholesky factorization 
* **FCore.Math** - contains mathematical functions, such as for calculation of the hyperbolic sine. 
* **FCore.Random** - contains random functions, such as for allowing the generation of samples from the binomial distribution.
